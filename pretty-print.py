'''
Write a function called pretty_print that accepts a complex dictionary and prints out all of it's keys and all of its values. 
The dictionary can have dictionaries nested inside of it.

HOW TO:

Make the function accept two parameters: pretty_print(dictionary, indent).
* dictionary is the dictionary that's currently being iterated over.
* indent is a string representing the current level of indentation.

Whenever you make a recursive call increase the level of indentation by adding two spaces to indent:

It's useful to know how to detect if an object is an instance of a specific class in Python. 
Use the isinstance method to see if a value is an instance of a certain class.

Examples:

dicts:
o1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
o2 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"name": "Bruce Wayne", "occupation": "Hero"}, "d": 4}

pretty_print(o1, "")
a: 1
b: 2

pretty_print(o2, "")
a: 1
b: 2
c:
  name: Bruce Wayne
  occupation: Hero
d: 4
'''

# use these for testing
o1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
o2 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"name": "Bruce Wayne", "occupation": "Hero"}, "d": 4}
o3 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"name": "Bruce Wayne", "occupation": "Hero", "friends": {"spiderman": {"name": "Peter Parker"}, "superman": {"name": "Clark Kent"}}}, "d": 4}


def pretty_print(dictionary, indent = ''):
  # for every key in the dictionary
  for key in dictionary:
    if type(dictionary[key]) == type({}):
      print(f'{indent}{key}')
      pretty_print(dictionary[key], "   " if indent == '' else indent + indent)
    # check the value of the key
    else:
      print(f'{indent}{key}: {dictionary[key]}')
    # recursive case: if the value is a dictionary, then we will recursively invoke
    # base case: otherwise, we will pring out the key/value pair

pretty_print(o3)
